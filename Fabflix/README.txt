To find the average TS and TJ, we read in a log file named “logFile.txt” The log files in the submission had their names changed so that they can be differentiated from. The log file should be in the same directory as the parser file. When the parser file is run, it reads in the log file and iterates over each line in the log file adding the times to the total while also keeping track of how many entries there are. When there are no more entries, it divides the times by the number of entries that were found. Since the times in the log files are in nanoseconds, we convert them to milliseconds and then display to the console.
